## Installation instructions
1. Clone this directory into any folder (I use .config/tmux usually) and copy the .tmux.conf file to your home directory.
2. Run tmux.
3. You should see everything load in on the top status bar, but may be in black and white.
4. Press prefix (default Ctrl+b) + I (capital i, as in Install) to fetch the plugins and finish the setup
